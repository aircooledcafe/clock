# JavaScript Clock

A simple JavaScript Clock

A simple Javascript clock I built to learn how to build a progressive web app.
Has a day and night mode, the clock goes red for night mode.

In progress:
Add manifest and service worker to make into a PWA.
Add code to make installable on mobile/desktop OS.

TO DO:
Add an alarm function.
